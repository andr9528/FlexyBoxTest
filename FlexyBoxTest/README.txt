In an ideal world the "FlexyBoxTest.Domain" project would have the sub-folder "Core" moved to a seperate library.
I had done that in the start, but i ran into issues that, i gave up on, after about 2 hours of attempting to find a solution to.
I will use more time than 2 hours to solve an issue if needed, but as this is only a test, i found i more usefull to complete the tasks

Note that "FlexyBoxTest.Utility" and "FlexyBoxTest.Domain" target .Net Standard, meaning both .Net Framework and .Net Core projects can use them.

I Have marked classes and methods with comments telling which task they where created to fullfil. 
Not all classes and methods are marked, as some have been created to maintain readability of the code.
